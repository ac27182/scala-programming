## part 1: Introduction to functional programming

### definitions

`Pure Function:` A pure function is a function with zero side effects, where a side effect is anything other than returning a result.

`Referential Transparency:` An expression is called 'referentially transparent' if it can be replace with its corresponding value, without changing the programs behavior. This requires that the expression be pure

`Expression:`

`Substitutional Model:`

### annecdotes

"functional programming is a restriction on how we write programs not on what programms can express"

"the discaplines of functional programming are tremendously benneficial because of the increase in modularity we gain from programming in pure functions"

"because of their modularity pure functions are easy to test, resuse, parallelize generalize and reason about. Furthermore pure functions are less prone to bugs"

"funtional programmers often speak of implementing programs with a pure core and a thin layer on the outside that handles effects"

## part 2: functional design and combinator libraries

## misc

- singly linked list

- equational resoning

- local reasoning

- composable
